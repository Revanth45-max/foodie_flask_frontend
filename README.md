# JvnkFoods React Cart App

This is a simple cart application built with React, Redux Toolkit and localStorage. The app allows users to add and remove food items from a cart, with the cart state being saved in the browser's localStorage. Notifications are handled using React-Toastify.

## Features

- **Add to Cart:** Users can add food items to the cart.
- **Remove from Cart:** Users can remove items from the cart.
- **Persistent State:** The cart state is saved in localStorage, so it remains intact even after the page is refreshed.
- **Notifications:** Provides feedback on actions (e.g., item added to cart) using React-Toastify.
- **React Redux Toolkit:** State management is handled using Redux Toolkit for better scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Official, recommended toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **localStorage:** Web storage API for storing data locally in the user's browser.
- **React-Toastify:** Library for displaying customizable toast notifications in React.
